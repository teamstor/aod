"If thou seeketh the path of inlightment, thou shalleth for eternity.
For the road to the abyss is paved with good intentions.
None art safe for the eye of the beholder for the beholder is me.
I who seeth all, judgeth all and punish all whom is not worthy of mine 
presence."

Long ago, in a land long forgotten, there was Light. This Light was 
a symbol for all that is good in this world, but everything has its 
oppositses. It had a brother. The Dark. For there could not be Light 
without Dark. Likevise, Dark could not exist without Light. They both 
stuggled to overcome the other, but in vain for they could not survive 
without the other. Through the ages both sides has had their champions. 
Whom has taken up the mantle of one side to fight for their existence and 
for dominence over therealm of man. This is where one story ends, and so, 
your begins.

Dark times these are. The lands infested with creatures foreign to the 
realm of man. A new dark lord has taken to rise in a far away country. 
The stuggle for power is clear.
Are you ready to fulfill your destiny?
